## Frequently Posted Issues

**I DO NOT HOST THE CHAPTER CONTENT**
This means I can't fix formatting errors, missing chapters, wrong chapters etc. I work to add new data sources in the future but at the moment I can't do anything about it.

**1. The download is stuck at the last step**

Try a different browser, especially on mobile quite a few of them don't support the library used to create the epub files. Firefox seems to work at the moment.

**2. Chapter X on novel Y is incomplete/missing/broken/not updated/wrong order**

I do not store any content, so I'm unable to fix these kind of errors.
Exception: Chapter's with the same title appear more then once in a novel. This error seems to be on my end and some novels are affected. Feel free to open up an issue with the name of the novels and I will fix the error.

## Correctly Posting a New Issue

- When creating a new issue for a potential bug fix, it is important to be as detailed as possible since most of the bugs come from not supported hardware or browsers. A detailed bug report makes the fix easier and faster :)
